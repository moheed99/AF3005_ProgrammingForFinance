ROSCA Management App 💰📊
🔹 Overview
The ROSCA Management App is a user-friendly platform designed to manage Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCA), commonly known as "Committee System" in many cultures. It helps users efficiently track member contributions, randomly select winners, and visualize financial data, making informal group savings easier and more transparent.

✨ Key Features:
✅ Create & Manage Committees – Easily add multiple members, set contribution amounts, and manage committee rotations.
✅ Automated Contributions – Track each member’s monthly contribution in real-time.
✅ Spinning Wheel for Random Selection – A dynamic spinning wheel visually picks the committee winner in a fair and engaging way.
✅ Data Visualization – View financial progress using interactive charts.
✅ Secure & Persistent Storage – Saves committee records to prevent data loss.
✅ Downloadable Reports – Export financial data to CSV for record-keeping.

📌 How It Works?
1️⃣ Create a Committee: Add members and set a fixed contribution amount.
2️⃣ Track Contributions: Each month, members deposit their share.
3️⃣ Spin the Wheel: A randomized spinning wheel selects a winner who receives the total pool.
4️⃣ Monitor Finances: View contribution history and current funds through graphs.
5️⃣ Export Data: Save records as CSV for easy reference and accountability.
